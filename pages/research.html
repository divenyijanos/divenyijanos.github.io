    <h2>The Effect of Retirement on Cognitive&nbsp;Performance</h2>
<p>Working&nbsp;paper.</p>
<p>All papers dealing with the effect of retirement on old age cognitive
performance are trying to sell their strategy as the only best. I choose another
way to act: instead of throwing out all previous work I put the pieces together
to see the broader picture. I draw the attention to potential biases and assess
their magnitude. Then, I build a new approach on the lessons learnt from the
studies and utilizing the panel structure of the Survey of Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe (<span class="caps">SHARE</span>) I show that if retirement has any adverse effect on
cognitive performance it should be really small in&nbsp;magnitude.</p>
<h2>The Impact of Elite High Schools on Academic Performance in&nbsp;Hungary</h2>
<p>Joint with S. Sóvágó (<span class="caps">VU</span> Amsterdam) <br/>
Working&nbsp;paper.</p>
<p>Selective schools attract high-achievers whose academic performance stands out.
Does this achievement gap stem purely from selection or selective schools have
value-added as well? This paper addresses this question by studying the effect
of elite high school attendance on short-term academic performance in Hungary.
Hungarian elite high schools track students at age 10 and 12 and offer special
curriculum in addition to the high peer quality. Our research design provides
non-parametric bounds on the effect of elite schools for those who actually
attend them. For the identification, we assume that more able students select
into the program and that the program does not impair the performance of
participants. In addition to that, we tighten the bounds using parental
education and the number of books at home as monotone instruments. We find that
at least half of the achievement gap in numeracy and literacy test scores
between elite and non-elite school pupils stem from selection. Furthermore, we
provide evidence that elite high schools boost academic performance by at least
0.08-0.13 standard deviations after two years of treatment, and this positive
effect persists after four years as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h2>The Revolution in Economic Data and Panel&nbsp;Econometrics</h2>
<p>Joint with L. Balázsi, G. Kézdi, and L. Mátyás

in Hungarian, original title: A közgazdasági adatforradalom és a panelökonometria. 
<a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ksaszemle/1515.htm">Paper</a></p>
<p>The main aim of this survey is to present, through the history and development
of panel data econometrics, the data revolution currently under way in
economics. We are demonstrating that progress is happening from the bottom up:
the emergence different panel data sets brings to light different questions and
problems, which then inspire and bring new theoretical and methodological
results, which in turn may result in new, more informative, more complex data
sets. This feedback mechanism is the main engine behind the current dig data
revolution, and as a result we are getting a deeper, more complex and nuanced
picture of the&nbsp;economy.</p>
<h2>Low employment among the 50+ population in Hungary: the role of incentives, health and cognitive&nbsp;capacities</h2>
<p>Joint with G. Kézdi

<a href="https://books.google.hu/books?id=pDskBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;ots=eUEaA88gtK&amp;dq=Low%20employment%20among%20the%2050%2B%20population%20in%20Hungary%3A%20the%20role%20of%20incentives%2C%20health%20and%20cognitive%20capacities&amp;hl=hu&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Preview</a></p>
<p>Employment rate in Hungary among the 50+ population is among the lowest in
Europe. Analyzing the first results of the Survey of Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe (<span class="caps">SHARE</span>) for Hungary we make three main points regarding the
employment gap: (1) Earnings in Hungary are very close to retirement income,
creating incentives to retire early. (2) Hungarians are in significantly worse
health than the people in most other European countries. (3) The employment gap
between Hungary and Europe is largest among people with bad health and low&nbsp;skills.</p>
