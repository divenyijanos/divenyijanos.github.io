    <h2>Task&nbsp;1</h2>
<p>Download the <code>civil-rights-act.csv</code> from the Data section (it might make sense
to look at the description file as well). Using the data answer the questions
below (run&nbsp;regressions).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which of the two parties (democrats and republicans) were more
supportive for the Civil Rights Act? First, look at a scatter plot. It might
help to experiment with <code>jitter</code> to see the points better. (<em>Hint:</em> look at
<a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_jitter.html">this</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a regression of the dummy of voting on the dummy of
party (note that <code>R</code> is automatically going to use a character variable in a
regression as a dummy.). What are the shares of the two parties who voted for
the&nbsp;act?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which states (northern or southern) were more supportive for the act?
What are the shares of the representatives in the two groups of states who
voted for the&nbsp;act?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When controlling for the state which party were more supportive for
the act? How does it compare to what you found in task b)? How could you
explain the&nbsp;difference?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task&nbsp;2</h2>
<p>Use the <code>easyshare_sample.csv</code> for this task. This is a sample of the easyshare
project (you can read more about this <a href="http://www.share-project.org/">here</a>).
The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe is a multidisciplinary
panel survey targeting individuals above 50 years. Hungary participated once,
in the 4th wave. The data is about the Hungarian sample with only a few
variables: <code>lm_status</code> is originally called as <code>ep005_</code>, <code>mbirth</code> as <code>dn002_mod</code>.
You can read about the variables <a href="http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_documentation/easySHARE_Release_2.0.0.pdf">here</a>.
The recall variables contain scores from a simple memory test: 10 simple words
are listed to the participants of the survey which they should repeat once
immediately (<code>recall_1</code>) and once with some delay (<code>recall_2</code>). The sum of these
two numbers (ranging from 0 to 20) form a great measure for the memory of the&nbsp;elderly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Know your data. Look at summaries, strange values, and try to clean them.
(<em>Hint:</em> negative values usually mean missing values, turn them into <code>NA</code>-s.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new dummy variable which takes one for those who do not work (for whom
<code>lm_status</code> not equal to 2). Create a new variable which is the total word&nbsp;recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at whether the memory of those who are not working are worse than those
who do. Run a regression which answers this question and interpret the&nbsp;coefficients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any other variable you may want to include the regression to get
closer to the answer of the question whether working preserves ones memory?
Include it in the regression and interpret your&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task&nbsp;3</h2>
<p>Collect the data you would like to use for your term project. Make a plot, or run a regression using that data, and interpret your&nbsp;results.</p>
<h2>Task&nbsp;+1</h2>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM">this video</a>
and collect 3 positive (or negative) points about the&nbsp;presentation.</p>
